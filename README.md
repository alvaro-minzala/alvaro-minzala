### Hi there 👋

I'm Álvaro. I'm a high-school student and I like coding and playing Minecraft.

Tech specs:
the Mac that I'm going to get really soon: MacBook Pro(M2 base model because I can't afford more :) preloaded with macOS 12 Monterey but I will update to macOS 13 Ventura on a separate partition(because of beta software).


Current Mac: MacBook mid 2009(the white one), patched to macOS 11 Big Sur

I also have a PC and an iPad(does an iPad count as a computer?)


Have a nice day/night/whatever.
